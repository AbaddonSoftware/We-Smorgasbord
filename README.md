# We-Smorgasbord
A potluck scheduler application for the web

## **Overview**
The goal here is to create a Minimum Viable Product example of a potluck scheduling app that would allow families, friends, and/or co-workers to schedule and RSVP for events that include a pot-luck style meal. Once logged in users should be able to add or remove items to the potluck and commit to bringing items. 

My intent is to make it possible for users to easily bring partial amounts of requested or suggested items such as 50 of 100 taco shells in the cases of large potlucks where more than one person might be responsible for an item but a specified amount is requested or suggested. This was a feature requested for a family reunion recently and that is where this project idea comes from. 

## **Features**

- [ ] User should be able to register an account.
- [ ] User should be able to login to their account. 
- [ ] Logged in user should be able to create an event featuring a potluck with suggested/requested food items.
- [ ] Logged in user should be able to update page to indicate they are bringing some/all of a suggested requested food item.
- [ ] Logged in user should be able to edit their previous actions for items.

## **Technologies**

- Java
- SpringBoot
- Thymeleaf Templates
- MySql
- Hibernate
- Haven't committed to what new thing I will learn but for now I will list Spoonacular api. Could be used to showcase recipes for inspiration.

Below are some examples of how the UI might look and/or behave. These are works in progress and will be subject to change as the project advances.
