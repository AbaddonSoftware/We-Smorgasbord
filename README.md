# We-Smorgasbord
A potluck scheduler application for the web

The goal here is to create a Minimum Viable Product example of a potluck scheduling app that would allow families, friends, and/or co-workers to schedule events that include a pot-luck style meal. 

This list of requirements will increase as items are marked off.
- [ ] Create initial view with header including user login/register links
- [ ] Create User Registration Form page
- [ ] Make it possible to login as a user or register as new user
- [ ] Make it possible to create an event featuring a potluck

Below are some examples of how the UI might look and/or behave. These are works in progress and will be subject to change as the project advances.
